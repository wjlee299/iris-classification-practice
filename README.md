# Classic Iris Classification Practice

An exploration of the Iris dataset that goes through the core steps of ML workflow: data inspection, modeling, and interpretation.

## Overview

- **Exploratory analysis:** Visualizes distributions and relationships (histograms, pairplots, scatterplots) to build intuition and guide modeling decisions.
- **Modeling & validation:** Establishes a baseline and trains a logistic regression classifier, using cross-validation to assess robustness.
- **Hyperparameter exploration:** Investigates regularization strength and its effect on performance.
- **Error analysis:** Compares correct vs incorrect predictions to surface model blind spots, emphasizing interpretation beyond raw accuracy.

## Running the notebook
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
